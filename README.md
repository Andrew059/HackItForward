# About
Stratus is a Web Platform that aims to connect organizations directly with developers to find solutions and make real world impact. It was built in response to the year 2020... what a year. This year has revealed the most vurnable out of all of us, and has left the rest of us with much stronger will to HELP, and MAKE AN IMPACT. With the world shifting online, developers are becoming a nessecity in any organization. However, it is often the organizations with the least reasources, that are in need of developers. Stratus, was created to directly link these organizations with up and coming developers, who are in need of experience, and who's skill's could level up any organization.  

The driving functionality of Stratus are the challenge pages. If an Organization is in need of a piece of software, a website, etc, they would post a challenge prompt on a Challenge page, tag all the nessary skills, difficulties, urgencies that relate to the challenge, and then post. Developers then will be able to view these challenges, and make projects according to the organization's needs. This way, the Organization will be able to get free software to further their causes, and the Developers will get the experience they need to build their skills and progress in their career.
